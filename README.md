### C++ OOPS 50 Questions with Answers

**1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**

    o	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) introduces objects and classes to C++.

    o	Objects represent real-world entities, encapsulating data and behaviour.

    o	OOP emphasizes inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

    o	It enhances code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance.


**2. What are the four pillars of OOP?**

    o Encapsulation

    o Abstraction

    o Inheritance

    o Polymorphism


**3. Define Class and Object in C++.** <br>
***Class:***<br>
_Class in C++ is the building block that leads to Object-Oriented programming._
_It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions._


***Object:***<br>
_Object is an entity that have some properties, state and behaviour. It is an instance of a Class._
_To use the data and access functions defined in the class, we need to create objects._
_When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when an object is created memory is allocated._


**4.	Explain the concept of Abstraction in OOP.** <br>

   -Hides internal implementation details.

   -Defines interfaces for user interaction.

   -Promotes code modularity and reuse.

   -Enhances data security and maintainability.


**5.	What is Encapsulation, and how is it achieved in C++?**

***Encapsulation*** _in OOP is bundling data and methods within a class, hiding internal details from the outside.Encapsulation is achieved using access specifiers (public, private, protected) to control member visibility, ensuring data security._

**6.	How does Inheritance promote code reusability?** <br>
_Inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviours from another class, ***reducing duplication***, and ***enhancing maintainability***._
